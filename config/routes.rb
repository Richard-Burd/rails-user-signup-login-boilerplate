  # at the 6:51 mark, Avi sets the "Authorization callback URL" (in his newly created OAuth GitHub app) to the following:
  # http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback
  # the get request below must match the "Authorization callback URL" you specify in the GitHub OAuth app.
  get '/auth/:provider/callback' => 'sessions#create'
  # You can create a new OAuth (same thing as OmniAuth) on GitHub by going here: https://github.com/settings/developers

  # The second part of this OmniAuth business is to go to this directory: config/initializers
  # and create a file called "omniauth.rb"
  # WARNING WARNING WARNING - this "omniauth.rb" file will contain sensitive data, so if you haven't done so already, you first need to create
  # a ".gitignore" file in the root directory and then specifically include this file: config/initializers/omniauth.rb
  # INFO INFO INFO - If you're using this Rails app as a starting point for your Rails project, relax, the ".gitignore" has already been created for you,
  # and it includes the "config/initializers/omniauth.rb" - this means no sensitive data will be compromised.

  # In this project there is a file here: config/initializers/omniauth_boilerplate.rb
  # Go there next & follow instructions to setup OmniAuth-GitHub

  resources :users

  # This route grabs the homepage for the actual app you're building
  get '/homeapp' => "site#homeapp"
